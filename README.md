## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE SHARING HUB</h3>
The Community Knowledge Sharing Hub (CKSH) is a grassroots-level solution designed to empower small and marginal farmers with localized, accessible, and practical agricultural knowledge. It addresses the critical information gap that currently forces farmers to depend on unscientific advice, local shopkeepers, or trial-and-error methods for key decisions such as crop selection, pest control, irrigation, and fertilizer use.
The CKSH will function as a physical and/or mobile center located within the village or cluster of villages, making it easy for farmers to access. It will be managed by trained community volunteers or progressive farmers who understand both traditional practices and modern farming techniques. These facilitators will act as bridges between expert sources and local farmers, ensuring trust and effective communication.
The hub will provide personalized, real-time advisory services by combining data inputs (such as soil health, crop history, and weather forecasts) with expert guidance and community insights. It will feature content and services delivered in the local language through simple formats like posters, audio guides, printed booklets, voice messages, and live group sessions. For digitally literate farmers, basic mobile tools or WhatsApp channels will also be available.
Regular farmer group meetings will be held at the hub to share seasonal advisories, best practices, and to address emerging issues like pest outbreaks, crop disease, or rainfall variability. These meetings will also foster peer-to-peer learning, where farmers exchange their own experiences, methods, and solutions, encouraging collective problem-solving and innovation.
The CKSH will actively blend traditional agricultural wisdom with verified scientific practices, offering an integrated knowledge system. For instance, it might promote organic pest control methods rooted in indigenous knowledge, but time their application using modern weather predictions. This inclusive approach makes adoption more culturally acceptable and contextually relevant.
Moreover, the hub will serve as a gateway to government schemes, financial services, crop insurance, and training programs. Many small farmers are unaware or unable to access such schemes due to documentation issues or lack of information. CKSH volunteers can assist with applications and follow-ups, making governance more farmer-friendly.
Over time, the hub can also evolve into a community-led agri-resource center, offering add-on services like market price updates, soil testing, seed banks, or access to agricultural equipment. As the model matures, it can be scaled across multiple regions, each customized for local crops, climate, and language.
In summary, the CKSH is more than just an advisory point — it is a holistic, decentralized, farmer-empowerment system designed to improve productivity, reduce input costs, preserve the environment, and build resilient rural communities.

## Technical Approach
The technical implementation of the CKSH combines low-cost digital tools, community facilitation, and data-backed agricultural advisory. Each hub will be equipped with a basic smartphone or tablet preloaded with local language content, audio files, and simple advisory apps. For areas with limited internet connectivity, offline tools like printed guides, voice notes, and community radio announcements will be used. Farmers will receive updates on pests, weather alerts, and planting schedules via voice messages or SMS in their native language. An optional integration with platforms like DeHaat, KrishiHub, or public databases (Soil Health Card data, IMD weather reports) will help deliver personalized recommendations. Community facilitators will be trained to collect basic data (crop type, sowing date, etc.) from farmers to generate targeted advice. A helpline or WhatsApp-based Q&A support system will allow farmers to reach experts when needed. These technical components are intentionally low-bandwidth, language-accessible, and designed for non-smartphone users. By building a hybrid (offline + digital) model, the solution remains inclusive while introducing digital benefits.

## Feasibility and Viability
The CKSH model is highly feasible due to its low-cost, community-driven, and modular design. It leverages existing infrastructure such as Panchayat buildings, schools, or FPO offices, minimizing setup costs. Volunteers or farmer champions already trusted in the community can be trained with minimal investment. Content can be sourced or adapted from government agencies (e.g., ICAR, KVKs) or agri-tech startups, reducing the need for original content creation. Technologically, the hub does not require advanced equipment or continuous internet access, ensuring operability even in remote villages. Viability is strengthened by potential collaborations with government departments, CSR initiatives, and agri-extension programs. Over time, hubs can be sustained through community ownership or small revenue streams, such as paid services for soil testing, premium advisory, or linkages to input providers and markets. Social viability is ensured through local engagement, language alignment, and trust in peer-led models. CKSH is scalable, replicable, and adaptable across different agro-climatic zones of India

## Impact and Benefits

The implementation of Community Knowledge Sharing Hubs will lead to tangible improvements in farmer livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and rural knowledge ecosystems. Farmers will experience increased crop productivity due to better crop selection, timely pest control, and efficient fertilizer usage. Input costs will reduce as farmers shift from guesswork and overuse of chemicals to precise, need-based practices. Peer-to-peer learning and localized guidance will improve trust and adoption of sustainable methods. The hub will reduce dependency on exploitative advice from local shopkeepers and encourage informed decision-making. Environmental impact will be positive through decreased chemical usage and adoption of eco-friendly methods. Social cohesion will improve as the hub becomes a central space for farmer collaboration and problem-solving. Long-term, CKSH will build community resilience against climate risks, market shocks, and policy changes. It will also improve access to government schemes and subsidies by making farmers more informed. Overall, the CKSH model empowers rural communities with knowledge, agency, and a pathway toward sustainable, profitable agriculture.
